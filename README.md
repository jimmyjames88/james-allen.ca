Dear Hiring Manager,

I built this website back in 2012. I made it mobile responsive some time around 2016.
Aside from that, it hasn't received any major updates beyond occasionally updating my
portfolio and resume.  I receive plenty of compliments on it (from non devs) so I am relucant
to replace it :D

Anyways, don't judge it too harshly.  It was kinda nifty for it's time!
